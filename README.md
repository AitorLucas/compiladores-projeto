# Analisador L√©xico e Sint√°tico para Linguagem RPN Personalizada

Este projeto implementa um analisador l√©xico e sint√°tico para uma linguagem baseada em Nota√ß√£o Polonesa Reversa (Reverse Polish Notation - RPN), com suporte a estruturas condicionais (`if-then-else`) e de repeti√ß√£o (`for`). 

---

## üìú Descri√ß√£o

O analisador realiza:

1. **An√°lise L√©xica**  
   Converte o c√≥digo-fonte em uma sequ√™ncia de tokens reconhec√≠veis, como n√∫meros, operadores, identificadores, palavras-chave, etc.

2. **An√°lise Sint√°tica**  
   Verifica se os tokens seguem a gram√°tica da linguagem, suportando express√µes RPN, condicionais e loops `for`.

---

## üß± Estrutura do Projeto

- `TokenType`: Enumera√ß√£o com todos os tipos de tokens.
- `Token`: Classe que representa um token com tipo, valor e posi√ß√£o no c√≥digo.
- `Lexer`: Classe respons√°vel por transformar o c√≥digo-fonte em tokens.
- `Parser`: Classe que verifica a estrutura sint√°tica dos tokens.
- `main()`: Ponto de entrada do programa, que executa o lexer e o parser com um arquivo de entrada.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Como Usar

### Pr√©-requisitos

- Python 3.x instalado.

### Execu√ß√£o

```bash
python Calc.py <arquivo_entrada>
```

#### Exemplo: 

```bash
python Calc.py test1.txt
```

## üìò Sintaxe Suportada

- Operadores Aritm√©ticos: +, -, *, /, %, ^, |
- Operadores de Compara√ß√£o: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
- Palavras-chave: if, then, else, for, MEM, RES
- Par√™nteses: Usados para delimitar express√µes
- Identificadores: Nomes de vari√°veis v√°lidas
- Express√µes Condicionais:
    - (if (x y 'condicional') then (...) else (...))

```
Tal que: 
    x, y s√£o n√∫meros reais
    'condicional' √© um operador de compara√ß√£o
    ... s√£o blocos de express√µes quaisquer
```

- Loops `for`:
    - (for (variavel start end) (...))
```
Tal que:
    'variavel' √© o nome da variavel que ser√° utilizada dentro do loop
    start √© um n√∫mero inteiro do in√≠cio do loop
    end √© um n√∫mero inteiro do final do loop
    ... √© um bloco de express√£o onde est√° dispon√≠vel a 'variavel'
```

---

## üì§ Sa√≠da

- Tokens gerados s√£o exibidos com tipo, valor, linha e posi√ß√£o.
- Valida√ß√£o sint√°tica imprime se h√° ou n√£o erros.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tratamento de Erros

- Tokens inv√°lidos s√£o classificados como `ERROR`.
- Par√™nteses n√£o balanceados ou estruturas incompletas s√£o sinalizadas.
- Erros sint√°ticos exibem n√∫mero da linha e posi√ß√£o.

---

## üìÅ Exemplo de Arquivo de Entrada

Arquivos de teste inclu√≠dos no reposit√≥rio:

- `test1.txt`
- `test2.txt`
- `test3.txt`
